# Design principles

## Bootstrap

We use [React Bootstrap components](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) underneath as implementation for our own custom components, so we can recreate the same look
and feel in React as we had in AngularJS.

Every Bootstrap component we use in React should be wrapped in a custom component inside the ui folder.
That way we have a more centralized place to define how it's styled and how it should behave.

Props on the custom components should not be passed "automatically" to the Bootstrap component underneath.
We define a specific list of props we use per component to prevent too much flexibility.
If we _do_ need access to a prop that's not currently available, it can always be added.
Restricting access to props down the line is harder.

## Spacing

Components should never have a margin by default. When you put two components next to each other they should "stick" by default. This way you can easily play with different spacing depending on the place where you use them.

When you want to add margin or padding to a component, you can use the following properties that are exposed by the `Box` component:

### Margin

- `marginLeft`
- `marginRight`
- `marginTop`
- `marginBottom`
- `marginX` (uses `marginLeft` and `marginRight`)
- `marginY` (uses `marginTop` and `marginBottom`)

### Padding

- `paddingLeft`
- `paddingRight`
- `paddingTop`
- `paddingBottom`
- `paddingX` (uses `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight`)
- `paddingY` (uses `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`)

The value you pass down to these properties is a number ranging from `0` to `a very big number`. Behind the scenes this number is parsed to a `rem` value following a specified function, so we get consistent spacing over all components.

## Box rules all

The Box component is **THE** primitive component what all components should be based on.

Box contains all the logic for our design and spacing system. Box contains all the margin- and padding-properties [as seen above](/?path=/story/introduction-design-principles--page#spacing), but it also contains tons of css properties like `height`, `fontSize`, `backgroundColor`, `animation`, ...
See the full list of properties [here](/?path=/story/primitives-box--default-story)

## Typography

The root font size is defined once globally and should not be overridden in specific components.

## Scoped styles

We use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) for the styling of our components which makes them scoped by default.
If you want to override certain Bootstrap styles you should add these values to our `theme.js` and import them by using the `getValueFromTheme` function.

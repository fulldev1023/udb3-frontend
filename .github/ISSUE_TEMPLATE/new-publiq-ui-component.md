## Use case

Add a clear use case for the component so any suggestions, discussions, conclusions, can be made with everyone having the same end goal in mind.

## Existing examples in the Legacy UI and/or Vue app

If the component is meant to centralize elements that currently exist in multiple places, describe the current styling in both the AngularJS app and/or Vue app. (Ideally with screenshots and links.)

If there are multiple variations describe the differences and whether you think they are justified because there are different use cases / contexts, or because it looks like accidental inconsistencies that we should unify.

## Proposed styling

Describe how the centralized component would look and behave moving forward.
If there are multiple variants, don't forget to list and describe/illustrate them all.
